# ![](/profile/assets/vixen_logo_md.png) Vixen Shell Project

## Presentation

The Vixen Shell project is an initiative dedicated to creating a highly customizable desktop environment for [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) users on Linux. Designed with a focus on development, it allows users to code the various components necessary to build their own desktop environment. This project is particularly useful for users of window managers such as [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) or [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).

Vixen Shell stands out by using [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the back-end, while the user interface (front-end) is developed with modern web technologies such as [React](https://fr.legacy.reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and CSS.
